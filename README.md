# Pseudospectral Methods in Optimal Control

Welcome to the repository for **Pseudospectral Methods in Optimal Control**. This repository contains my work and studies throughout my course on Pseudospectral Methods, focusing on topics ranging from interpolation to spectral methods and their application in optimal control.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following key topics, each with theoretical explanations, code examples, and related plots:


## Contents Overview

- **Optimal Control**: Methods for solving optimal control problems, including direct and indirect methods, and static Lagrange multipliers.
- **Interpolation**: Understanding interpolation methods, including Lagrange interpolation, Newton's divided difference, how the Vandermonde matrix is used in interpolation and Barycentric interpolation.   
- **Orthogonal Polynomials**: Exploring the properties and recurrence relations of Legendre, Chebyshev, and other orthogonal polynomials.
- **Spectral Methods**: A deep dive into Fourier series, Galerkin methods, and the application of spectral methods for solving boundary value problems.
- **Galerkin Method**: Deriving and analyzing the error terms and stability when applying Galerkin methods/approximation.
- **Gauss-Jacobi Integration**: Numerical integration using Gaussian quadrature and Chebyshev nodes.
- **Bernstein Polynomials**: Studying the Bernstein polynomials and their role in uniform approximation.
- **Fourier Approximation**

Each folder contains:
- *Theory files (Markdown)*: Overview and detailed explanations of key concepts.
- *Python code files*: Implementations and computations in Python, along with generated plots to visualize the theoretical concepts.
- *Plots*: Visualizations of various mathematical concepts, functions, and results.

  Compiled notes and can also split it into folder for each chapter along with respectiveÂ codes
